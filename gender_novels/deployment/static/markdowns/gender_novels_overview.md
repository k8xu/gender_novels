# Overview

## Our Goals
The use of gender has changed over the centuries in the use of our literature. Using 
novels from 1924 and earlier, we are able to study the prevalence of the various ways
that we gender language and analyze the differences in these based on region, 
author gender, time period, and more.

This quote from Steve Jobs exemplifies what we are trying to do at the DHL. By 
combining two fields - Humanities and Technology - that are traditionally thought to be mutually 
exclusive, we are able to draw conclusions and find connections that would otherwise be impossible.

The use of today’s computers and processing power allows us to analyze thousands of texts in a matter 
of hours - as opposed to the multiple lifetimes that it would otherwise take to compile an analysis by 
hand. This enables the DHL to draw conclusions and perform studies on the poets, philosophers, and 
writers of the past in ways that were never thought possible before the advent of these methods.
