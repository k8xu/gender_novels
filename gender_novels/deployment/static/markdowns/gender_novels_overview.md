## Our Goals

As the first project of the lab, we are very excited to begin our research in the 
field of gender studies. The use of gender has changed over the centuries, not only in our 
culture, but also in its role in our literature.  We are directing our research at novels written 
by authors as famous as Jane Austen and others that are much more obscure, such as Mary E. Mann. 
By looking at the history of our books, we hope to be able to study the ever-adapting 
and changing view on gender by writers all around the globe in the nineteenth and twentieth 
centuries.
