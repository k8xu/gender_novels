# Analysis

## Results
We ran programs looking at the relative frequencies of male pronouns compared to female pronouns 
used by authors at different time periods. The higher the frequency, the more male pronouns there 
were compared to the number of female pronouns.

We found this to be the most interesting piece of data. There is a significant 
difference in the male pronouns used by male authors compared to female authors. 
While female authors use pronouns such as "she" and "her" more often, they still show
a male bias.

The above graph shows that there is no initial trend that can be drawn between these ratios and a
specific time period. However, there seem to be spikes in the 1830s and the 1880s. Due to the 
currently somewhat small sample size of novels, it is difficult to know if these spikes are 
statistically significant or simply flukes.

## Our Data
Due to the availability of resources, it is necessary to point out that our analysis will not
precisely reflect popular literature in the 19th century. It is important to consider 
whether the obscurity/popularity of a novel is relevant to our analysis. For example, 19th 
century novels featuring more radical implications on gender roles may have become more 
well-known due to their claims. While the list of novels that we are pulling from is 
comprehensive, it is by no means a complete account of every book, or even every popular book, 
that was published at the time.
